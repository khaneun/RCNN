# Faster RCNN

Extract from the paper "Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks"
---
>> Our object detection system, called Faster R-CNN, is composed of two modules. 
>> The first module is a deep fully convolutional network that proposes regions, 
>> and the second module is the Fast R-CNN detector that uses the proposed regions.
>> The entire system is a single, unified network for object detection.
